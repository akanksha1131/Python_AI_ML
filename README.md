****Project's Title:****
Fraud Detection System for Banking Transactions
****Project Description:**** 
Our project, named PS_CodeBytes, is a comprehensive solution aimed at addressing fraud detection in banking transactions. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and data visualization techniques, our system aims to identify fraudulent activities, providing insights and recommendations for integration into existing banking infrastructure. With a focus on data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building, we strive to develop an ensemble of highly accurate models capable of effectively detecting fraudulent transactions. Our project also explores the future scope of continuous and self-learning models, user behavior analysis, and deep learning architectures for enhanced fraud detection capabilities. Through collaboration and innovation, we aim to create a robust solution that safeguards financial institutions against fraudulent activities, ultimately contributing to a safer and more secure banking environment.
